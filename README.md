# test-pinia2

I was having issues bolting Pinia into existing Vue project. Wrote this to be a super simple Vue3 Pinia example for my learning/understanding.

Hopefully this may be of use to others:

- Single Pinia store using Composition API
- Example route guard using store state
- Example show/don't show menu choice depending on store state
- Example page transitions

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```
